# Lazer prompt for ZSH

Basic reimplementation of [Starship Prompt](https://github.com/starship/starship).

This is the way i learn rust, zsh, prompts and other stuff: by implementing it myself with reference.

TODO:

[ ] .toml config
[ ] unicode support (graphemes, etc)
[ ] proper error handling
[ ] debug output and error display in debug mode
[ ] RPROMPT and add_new_line support
